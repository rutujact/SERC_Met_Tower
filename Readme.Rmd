## Minute and daily data from the meteorological tower at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC)

We have published two data files that contain minute-scale meteorological data and aggregations of those data at the daily scale. This document describes the basic collection and processing of the data, the variables used, and some of the filters and interpolation strategies used to gap-fill and correct the data.  A more detiailed exposition of this workflow can be found in the [Updater markdown file](Updater.html), where the code that actually processes the data is presented and described. The original data and unfilled data are available on request if a user wishes to use their own gap-filling algorithms.

### Sensors and data description

**Description of sensors used to collect the data**
SERC collects weather data using various instruments located on top of a 40 m tower, located at 38.89 N, 76.56 W (NAD27), near the Mathias Laboratory on the SERC campus.  Additional observations are made at a forest floor (below canopy) site located ~30 m to the west of the tower. Meteorological observations at the tower site began in 2002.  Previously, routine observations were made at ground level location near the Schmidt Center also near the Mathias Laboratory.

For a full description of instrumentation see file from [this instrument description document](literature/SERC Tower Instrument Description.docx) which describes the instrumentation deployed by [the SERC Photobiology Lab.](https://serc.si.edu/labs/photobiology-and-solar-radiation)

**Climate variables collected and calculated**
There are six data files published in this collection, described in [Table 1](#datafiles). Data collected from the sensors include observed variables, such as temperature and relative humidity, and calculated variables, such as vapor pressure deficit (VPD). [Table 2](#minute.variables) presents the variables for minute file, while [Table 3](#daily.variables) for daily files, along with their units. Most users would want to use daily or minute data without gaps--these are provided by gap-filling with climatic averages described below. The percentage of data missing before this gap-filling is presented in [Table 4](#missing.minute) & [Table 5](#missing.daily).

### Filtering, corrections, and gap-filling

**Missing data** Note that significant gaps exist in the data for Temperature and Relative Humidity.  *Forest Floor* Temperature and Relative Humidity readings are problematic from August 1, 2013 until end of 2014. For *Tower Top* they are problematic from Jan 2015 through March 9, 2017 (new sensor unit was installed 3/9/2017).

Over any long data gathering period, instruments change. That is the case with this data. Most importantly, instruments degrade and are replaced or re-calibrated. For a full account of instrument changes and data adjustment issues see [Updater markdown file](Updater.html) and [documentation](literature/Readme for Tower and Forest Floor Temperature and Relative Humidity data.docx) from the [SERC Photobiology lab.](https://serc.si.edu/labs/photobiology-and-solar-radiation)

**Filtering** In the minute data, Temp.tower is removed when RH.tower > 100 during January-01-2015 to November-13-2015 and February-08-2016 to March-09-2017. RH.tower is flagged in column tower.RH.Flag as 0 from January-01-2015 to November-13-2015 (records ~ 6% lower RH), while from February-08-2016 to March-09-2017 RH.tower is removed. RH.floow and RH.tower values < 10 are also removed.

Beyond the imposed limits in Table 2, seasonally removals of daily data were made according to the following:

Temperatures < 4 $^\circ$C in summer (doy > 150 & doy < 270)
Temp < 4 $^\circ$C in summer (doy > 150 & doy < 270) are also removed.
Temp < 4 $^\circ$C in summer (doy > 150 & doy < 270) are also removed.

In daily summary data RHmax in summer (doy > 150 & doy < 330) below 30%, RHmin below 10%, Tmax below 4 deg C and Tmin below 0 deg C are considered unacceptable and removed.

**Replacing seasonally unacceptable extremes**

**RHmax in summer below 30 looks unacceptable**
RHmax.floor[Julian >150 & Julian < 330 & RHmax.floor < 30] <- NA
RHmax.tower[Julian >150 & Julian < 330 & RHmax.tower < 30] <- NA
**RHmin in summer below 10 looks unacceptable**
RHmin.floor[Julian > 130 & Julian < 330 & RHmin.floor < 10] <- NA
RHmin.tower[Julian > 130 & Julian < 330 & RHmin.tower < 10] <- NA

**Tmax in summer below 4 looks unacceptable**
Tmax.floor[Julian > 150 & Julian < 270 & Tmax.floor < 4] <- NA
Tmax.tower[Julian > 150 & Julian < 270 & Tmax.tower < 4] <- NA
**Tmin in summer below 0 looks unacceptable**
Tmin.floor[Julian > 150 & Julian < 270 & Tmin.floor < 0] <- NA
Tmin.tower[Julian > 150 & Julian < 270 & Tmin.tower < 0] <- NA


**Gap-filling** Daily summaries of missing data as well as data removed as above, ---for Forest Floor alone-- are gap-filled from green-house data. Remaining gaps in daily data are filled with climatalogical means (doy means). All gaps in minute data are filled with climatalogical means (doy-minute means).

##### Table 2: Minute data in minute scale datasets
This refers to the files SERC_minute_data.Rda and SERC_minute_data.h5.

Limits for time variables are the ranges in the data as they are--included to show the available date range, limits for other variables are imposed for cleaning. Saturated Vapour Pressure (SVP) is derived using temperature (Temp) based on Buck's equation: SVP = 0.61121 x exp((18.678 - Temp/234.84) * (Temp/(257.14 + T))). Vapour Pressure Deficit (VPD) is derived using SVP and relative humidity (RH) as VPD = SVP x (1 â€“ RH/100).
